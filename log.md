# 100 Days Of ML Code - Log

### Day 0: July 8, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Started Week 1 of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course on Coursera.

**Thoughts:** Many people highly recommended this course so I will start my journey with this MOOC. Its an 11 week course and I want to try to complete it within 2-3 weeks depending on how hard it is.
