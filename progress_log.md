# 100 Days Of ML Code - Log

### Day 0: July 8, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Started Week 1 of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course on Coursera.

**Thoughts:** Many people highly recommended this course so I will start my journey with this MOOC.

### Day 1: July 9, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Week 1: Cost Function and Gradient Descent

**Thoughts:** Really great course so far, I feel my intuition is getting better and I understand how calculus helps the learning process in machine learning.


### Day 2: July 10, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Watched 3Brown1Blues videos on Neural Networks

**Thoughts:** Great for deepening my understanding of neural nets.

### Day 3: July 14, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Completed Week 1 of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course
**Side Note** Had a few sick days in between day 2 and day 3 but back to 100% and ready to learn.
**Thoughts:** Completed Linear Algebra Section. There were several ML Hello World project ideas in 3Brown1Blues videos on Neural Networks so I plan to start working on some mini-projects to get my feet wet after I complete some more of Andrew Ng's course.

### Day 4: July 17, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Completed Start Week 2 of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course
**Thoughts:** Starting to use Matlab/Octave so things are getting interesting

### Day 5: July 17, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Notes on Octave (GNU Octave is software similar to MATLAB)
**Link to work:** [Octave Notes](octave_notes.md)
**Thoughts:** Starting to use Matlab/Octave so things are getting interesting

### Day 6: July 25, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Taking a deeper dive into SQL Databases specifically PostgreSQL

### Day 6: July 26, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Day 2 of PostgreSQL
